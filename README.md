This is the final project of The Odin Project foundations course. I will be creating a calculator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This calculator will be able to add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Users will be able to string together multiple operations with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. 

Extra Credit Includes
-Backspace button
-Decimal button with inability to add more than one to a number
-CSS style to look like a calculator
